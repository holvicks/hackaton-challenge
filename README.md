# hackaton-challenge
The Hackathon challenge is a Figma design that you have to bring to life as a frontend engineer. The Figma design is an exact replica of the Shopify onboarding dashboard. This is the dashboard that is used by Shopify's 1.75 million merchants to sell millions in ecommerce products.
